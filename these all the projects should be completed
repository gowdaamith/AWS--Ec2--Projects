Beginner EC2 Projects
1️⃣ Host a Static Website on EC2
Skills: EC2, Security Groups, Apache/Nginx, Linux basics
What you’ll do:

Launch an Amazon Linux EC2

Install Nginx/Apache

Serve a custom HTML/CSS site

Open port 80 in SG

Great for learning SSH, ports, web servers, security groups.

2️⃣ EC2 as a File Server
Skills: EC2, EBS, Linux permissions
What you’ll do:

Attach an extra EBS volume

Format, mount, and configure auto-mount using /etc/fstab

Host downloadable files

Teaches EBS, mounting, volume management.

3️⃣ Deploy a Python/Node.js App on EC2
Skills: Linux, runtime installation, PM2/systemd
What you’ll do:

Run a small backend (Flask, Express.js, FastAPI)

Reverse-proxy with Nginx

Create a service with systemctl

Great for backend deployments.

4️⃣ EC2 + Load Balancer (ALB)
Skills: ELB, Target Groups, Auto Scaling basics
What you’ll do:

Deploy an app on 2 EC2s

Register them in a Load Balancer

Access via a single DNS

Demonstrate high availability

You’ll learn real AWS production patterns.

5️⃣ EC2 + RDS (Full Web App Architecture)
Skills: RDS, EC2, networking, SG pairs
What you’ll do:

Set up a backend on EC2

Use MySQL/PostgreSQL RDS

Properly configure inbound SG

Test CRUD API

Real foundational project for backend engineers.

6️⃣ Setup a CI/CD Pipeline to EC2
Skills: CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, S3, IAM
What you’ll do:

Push code to GitHub/CodeCommit

Auto-deploy to EC2 using CodeDeploy agent

Zero-downtime rolling deployment

Great for DevOps résumé.

🧩 Advanced EC2 Projects
7️⃣ Auto Scaling Group (ASG) + Load Balancer
Skills: ASG, Launch Templates, Scaling Policies
Build:

Create a launch template

Attach it to an Auto Scaling Group

Auto-scale based on CPU

Connect to a Load Balancer

This is real production-grade architecture.

8️⃣ Multi-Tier Architecture (VPC + Subnets + EC2 + RDS + ALB)
Skills: VPC networking, NAT Gateway, routing tables
Architecture steps:

Public subnet → Load Balancer

Private subnet → EC2 backend

Private subnet → RDS

NAT Gateway for updates

Full secure architecture

This is a full cloud architecture project.

9️⃣ Host a Kubernetes Cluster on EC2 (Kubeadm)
Skills: EC2, networking, containerization, kubernetes
What you’ll do:

Deploy 1 master + 2 worker nodes

Install Docker & kubeadm

Deploy sample workloads

Manage cluster manually

Perfect for deep DevOps learning.

🔟 Build Your Own VPN Server on EC2
Skills: Networking, routing
Use: OpenVPN / WireGuard
You will:

Install VPN server

Configure clients

Route traffic through EC2

Good for learning advanced network security.

🔥 Premium, Resume-Boosting Project Ideas
11️⃣ Scalable Video Processing System (EC2 + S3 + SQS)
Upload video → S3

S3 event → SQS

EC2 worker reads SQS → processes video (FFmpeg)

Uploads result back to S3

This is an actual real-world system design project.

12️⃣ Build a Machine Learning Inference Server (EC2 + Docker)
Dockerize a ML model

Deploy inference API on EC2

Auto-scale based on request volume

Perfect for AI + DevOps combination.

13️⃣ Host a Game Server on EC2
Examples:

Minecraft

CS:GO

Rust

You’ll learn ports, CPU/memory usage, EBS performance, etc.
